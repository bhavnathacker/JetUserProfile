# JetUserProfile
This is a sample app(For beginners - App #1) built using Jetpack Compose. It is a simple - single screen app to demonstrate use of basic Jetpack Compose UI elements like Text, Image and Button & LazyColumn (Vertical Recyclerview). It also demonstrates how compose manages state with a Boolean State.

 Here, the state of Button click (isClicked) toggles each time button is clicked. 
 
 UI for Vertical List - "showing profiles" is driven by State of Button.
